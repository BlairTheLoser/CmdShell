CMDShell is a lightweight, custom command-line shell for Windows, designed for developers, IT professionals, and system enthusiasts.  
It combines familiar CMD commands with powerful file, system, and repair utilities, including:

- File operations: ls, mkdir, rm, rmdir, cat, copy, move, attrib  
- System repair: repair-mbr, repair-boot, repair-bcd, repair-files, scan-disk  
- Developer tools: sysinfo, env, whoami  
- Fallback to regular CMD commands automatically  

CMDShell features a custom prompt (`cmdshell$>`), easy-to-use interface, and is fully extendable with new commands.  
It’s perfect for testing, scripting, and system maintenance — all in a single batch file.
